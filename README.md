# NLP From Scratch:
This directory encompasses fundamental principles related to Natural Language Processing (NLP), The key concepts covered in this directory include:

1. **Stopwords**: Common words (e.g., "the," "and") often removed during text processing to improve efficiency. the list of stop words in english is shown in bellow.

3. **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: Assigning grammatical categories (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives) to words in a text.

4. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and categorizing entities such as names of people, places, organizations, and dates in text.

5. **Text Classification**: Categorizing text into predefined categories or labels, often used in sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and spam detection.

6. **Word2Vec**: A popular word embedding technique for representing words in a vector space.

7. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: A method to evaluate the importance of words in a document relative to a collection of documents.

8. **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., "running" to "run").

9. **Syntax and Parsing**: Analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences, including dependency parsing and constituency parsing.

10. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and categorizing entities such as names of people, places, organizations, and dates in text.

11. **Topic Modeling**: Discovering abstract topics within a collection of documents.

These foundational NLP concepts provide a solid groundwork for understanding and working with natural language data, enabling the development of various language processing applications, from chatbots to language translation systems.
